# VSON
VSON (Volumetric Symbolic Object Notation) is a lightweight, structured data format designed for trading systems and LLM-based data processing. It provides a symbolic, human-readable representation of market or analytical data that minimizes verbosity and reduces tokenization cost compared to JSON — making it ideal for AI/LLM integrations.
